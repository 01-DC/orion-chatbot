# Summary

This project was created as a part of Hello Hacks II. A one day Hackathon where learning is the main aim. We were free to make any project as per our choice. And this bot was really fun to work on.

## Inspiration

In this time of pandemic when everyone is at their homes, people are slowly losing their social skills and becoming more and more aloof. Spending time alone is cool but too much and we become socially inept.

## What it does

This chatbot will talk to you when you have no one else. Although not much it will still reply and continue talking.

## How we built it

We have built this bot using Jupyter notebook and Python3 kernel. We have also used tkinter library for the GUI.

## Challenges we ran into

Version 1 of the bot was using command line to take inputs and give replies. Integrating into the GUI took some time to figure out. A lot of work went into adding the weather api as well.

## What we learned

Using APIs in Python and tkinter library to make simple GUI

## What's next for Orion Chatbot

We will try to integrate NLP into this bot to make it more advanced and applicable in a variety of situations.

## Contributers

Big Thanks to Subham Bhansali and Satakshi Singh for making this possible :-)
